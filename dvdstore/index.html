	 There 7 reports available in the Admin Interface:
		<ol>
			<li><b>Top 5 Profitable DVDs</b> - This report lists top 5 DVDs that have the highest per unit
				profit (the sell price minus the cost)</li>
			<li><b>Stock Sales to Date</b> - This is a naive "Profit & Loss" statement. 
				It itemises each title and compares how many items we have sold with how many items we have in stock.</li>
			<li><b>Stock Status</b> - This tells teh user how much stock there is of each item. Items with less than 5 stock
				are highlighted yellow and items with no stock are highlighted red.</li>
			<li><b>Popular DVDs</b> - Lists the top 10 popular DVDs (DVDs are ranked popular by how many have been purchased).</li>
			<li><b>Customer Demographics</b> - Shows the demographics of the customers by state (ie: VIC, NSW, etc) and age group.</li>
			<li><b>Popular Genres</b> - Lists the top 10 popular genres (also ranked by how many DVDs have been bought). Note: that since
				DVDs can have multiple Genres, the total figure may be more than the total number of DVDs actually purchased.</li>
			<li><b>Best Customers</b> - Lists the five best customers ranked by how much they have spent.</li>
		</ol>
	There are two "views" or interfaces available - The <b>Customer</b> interface and the <b>Admin</b> interface.<br>
	The customer interface allows users to create their own account, log in, search for DVDs, add DVDs to their basket (or shopping trolley)
	and checkout (or purchase) the DVDs in their basket. It also allows them to edit their own profile (name, address, credit card details, etc).<br>
	The admin interface allows the admin to log in (password is <b><u>quasar</u></b>), add/edit/delete DVDs, add/edit/delete actors, add/edit/delete
	directors, add/edit/delete Genres, view reports and import XML data into the database.<br>
	<i>As a side note, the application won't let the admin user delete dvds that have been purchased/in baskets (but they can deactivate them). It also
	won't let him delete genres,actors or directors that are associated with at least one DVD.</i>
