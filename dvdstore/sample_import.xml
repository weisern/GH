<title>Bicentennial Man, The</title>
<synopsis>From director Chris Columbus comes this original, funny and heart-warming film.
When Richard Martin (Sam Neill) introduced a robot named Andrew (Robin Williams) to the family,
nobody expects anything more than an ordinary household appliance.
But this is no ordinary robot! Andrew is a unique machine with real emotions, a sense of humour and a 
burning curiosity to discover what it means to be human.
Over the course of his service with the Martins, spanning two hundred years and several generations, 
Andrew discovers much about the intricacies of life and love, and finds there are many things he can teach as well as learn.
Will Andrew ever achieve his goal to become human and possess the freedom to pursue a life of his own?
And will he be prepared to pay the cost?</synopsis>
